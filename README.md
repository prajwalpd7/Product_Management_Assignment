# Product Management Assignment

This repository contains the deliverables for the Product Manager assignment. It includes solutions for three problem statements:

1. **Product Requirement and Low-Fidelity Wireframes**  
   A security product that scans container images for vulnerabilities and presents users with actionable insights.

2. **Kubernetes Security Scan**  
   A solution that scans a local Kubernetes cluster (using tools like Kubescape) and outputs a JSON file with scan findings.

3. **GoLang Date & Time Web Application**  
   A simple web app that displays the current date and time. This app is containerized, deployed to Kubernetes with a declarative approach (2 replicas), and exposed to the Internet.
